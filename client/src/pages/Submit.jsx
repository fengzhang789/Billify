          medication noncompliance who presents with increasing right sided weakness and dysarthria of
          unknown duration less than one day, concerning for TIA versus CVA. Given the patientâ€™s
          history of previous stroke and well as noncompliance with medications, either of these would be
          most likely. Although less likely, other possibilities to explain this presentation include seizure,
          hypertensive urgency versus emergency, or intoxication versus withdrawal of drugs. With
          history of seizures, previous brain injury (CVA), and chronic cocaine abuse, recurrence of
          seizure could explain his presentation. However, his wife reports previous seizure episodes were unlike these recent symptoms, and his last seizure was approx 3 years ago. The patient also has a
          history of uncontrolled hypertension and noncompliance with medications. His significantly
          elevated BP probably is chronically high but could be elevated due to acutely increased
          intracranial pressure. He has no complaints of headache, changes in vision, or nausea/vomiting.
          Finally, although his drug usage probably contributed to these recent symptoms through
          mechanisms of cerebral ischemia via vasoconstriction, the presentation would be very atypical
          for acute intoxication or withdrawal.`;
